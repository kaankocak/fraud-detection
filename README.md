# Fraud Detection using Anomaly Detection Models

This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions using various unsupervised machine learning models. The models applied include Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor (LOF), One-Class SVM, and AutoEncoder.

## Project Structure
1. **Data Collection and Cleaning**: Data preprocessing steps to handle missing values and create necessary features.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Creating time-based and categorical features.
3. **Model Training**: Training multiple unsupervised models for anomaly detection.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance using Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and visualizing anomalies.
